            Back sometime in 2014 a <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/">Curseforge</a> user named TheVoid<br>
            wanted to test the limits of the efficiency enchantment. Out of this came a minigame idea. I assume that<br>
            out of this the idea evolved as the map was built. Logdtzip a big Minecraft Youtuber played the map and blew<br>
            it up. LogDotZip got a version of the map that was never released, a completely revamped beta was released,<br>
            and most people didn't like it. At this point TheVoid drops off the face of the Earth.

            Enter me. In 2018 youtube reccomends me a video by LogdotZip from 4 you years previous.<br>
            Of course I check out the map. As I have a coding passion, I tried to fix the bugs.<br>
            I realized that the issues were in the Minecraft version itself. As the VERY next version was<br>
            command block update, I had to completely re-do the entire thing. This is where I picked up. From scratch.<br>

            A Slow Trek
        </h2>
        <p>
            Two years. It took two years to finally figure out how to treat the now smart villagers.<br>
            I still havent created a working version of the map as of 2/15/2021. These two years I<br>
            have learned a lot about commands and datapacks. I first created an infinite storage room that<br>
            was very laggy. I released a half built re-design to version 1.12.2 vowing never to update past<br>
            1.13 as all the commands had changed, also removing one of the commands that was essential to<br>
            the map functioning. At this time I did not realize that this command had just been merged with<br>
            another one and when I attempted to update to 1.14 with the release of a command essential in<br>
            future planned updates, I had to find out how to use it. Then of course villagers sucked.<br>
            They got smart. This is why I still havent made a new update that works.<br>
        </p>
        <h2>
            The Future
        </h2>
        <p>
            As of 2/15/2021 the future contains a lot.<br>
            I plan on completing beta number 3 for the version 3.0.0.0.0 and providing hotfixes after that.<br>
            These hotfixes will attempt to add any features I missed(I have been very unorganized), squash bugs,<br>
            and add the new tiers I want to add before I update to caves and cliffs(1.17).<br>
            After all this I might as well make the update, adding to the world some of the builds I have wanted to add,<br>
            working on the banks update, and making sure everything works smoothly. I also plan to add a new custom<br>
            shops system. This should erase the issue with villagers discounting my prices. After this will come<br>
            either the Tier Expansion or the Exploration update. This is due to the fact that if I don't<br>
            have dungeons ready to import into the Minevolution world then I need to have another update available.<br>
            As 1.17 will be out at this point this update sounds ideal. Even though it would take longer to get<br>
            Dungeons in as I would have to add the update to more tiers(as per current plans), it would be content<br>
            Both updates WILL be coming, it is just the order that I don't have down.<br>
